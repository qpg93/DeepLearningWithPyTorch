    "### Data\n",
    "Generally, when we have to deal with image, text, audio or video data, we can use standard python packages that load data into a numpy array. Then we can convert this array into a __torch.*Tensor__.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For images, packages such as Pillow, OpenCV are useful\n",
    "* For audio, packages such as scipy and librosa\n",
    "* For text, either raw Python or Cython based loading, or NLTK and SpaCy are useful\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically for vision, we have created a package called __torchvision__, that has data loaders for common datasets such as Imagenet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. and data transformers for images, viz., __torchvision.datasets__ and __torch.utils.data.DataLoader__.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use the __CIFAR10__ dataset. It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’, ‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.\n",
